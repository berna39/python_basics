values = ['Meschack', 'Shadrack', 'abedNego']

for x in values: #nirmal loop
    print(x)

#now let try to print also the index of of each element

index = 0 
for x in values: #nirmal loop
    print(index, x)
    index += 1

#Another common way to approach this problem is to use range() combined with len() 
# to create an index automatically. This way, you donâ€™t need to remember to update the index

for index in range(len(values)):
    print(index, values[index])
